/*
    Rc<T> instance is only cleaned up if its strong_count is 0.

    You can also create a weak reference to the value within an Rc<T> instance by 
    calling Rc::downgrade and passing a reference to the Rc<T>

    Strong references are how you can share ownership of an Rc<T> instance. 
    Weak references donâ€™t express an ownership relationship, and their count 
    doesn't affect when an Rc<T> instance is cleaned up. 

    Calling Rc::downgrade increases the weak_count by 1, not the strong_count.
    The weak_count does not need to be 0 for the instance to be cleaned up.

    Since it is possible that after calling Rc::downgrade, the value doesn't exist
    anymore, you must call Rc::upgrade which will return an Option<Rc<T>>, populated
    with Some<Rc<T>> if the value still exists.
